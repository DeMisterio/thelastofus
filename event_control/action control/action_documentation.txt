the key algorithmetic logic: 

if Action if performed over some object: 

1)Check if item functionality allows it. 

for example if the clothing functionality is wear => 
and the user prompting is to wear the item, then the action is going to be performed
+ the effect is going to be applied. 

so how it works is:



User action 
    ↓
Does functionality exist?
    ├─ No → Do nothing
    └─ Yes
         ↓
Is it tool-based functionality?
    ├─ Yes
    │     ↓
    │  Is there an on-active subject? (target object)
    │         ├─ No → Do nothing
    │         └─ Yes → Do action on OBJECT Y using TOOL X
    │
    └─ No
         ↓
     Is object required?
           ├─ No → Do action (self-action)
           └─ Yes
                 ↓
          Is object present?
                 ├─ No → Do nothing
                 └─ Yes → Do action on object

ChatGPT made UseCases


⸻

1) ❌ User action does NOT exist

Player command:
	•	"skrrr bap bapadook"
	•	"🤡🤡🤡"
	•	"     "

Engine result:

Inner voice:
“I… can’t understand any of that.”

⸻

2) ❌ Functionality exists in English, but NOT in your engine

Player:
	•	"teleport to kitchen"
	•	"summon helicopter"
	•	"clone pistol"

Engine:

“If only I could do that…”

⸻

3) ✔ Functionality exists → but requires a tool → player has no tool

Player:

"cut the rope"

Rope exists, but NO knife/scissors.

Engine:

“I need something sharp.”

⸻

4) ✔ Requires tool → tool exists → but user didn’t specify a target

Player:
	•	"cut it"
	•	"ignite this"

Rasa returns NO entity.

Engine:

“Cut what exactly?”
“There’s nothing here to burn.”

⸻

5) ✔ Tool exists + target exists → but target is incompatible with action

Player:

"ignite the yogurt"

Yogurt cannot ignite.

Engine:

“…That won’t burn.”

Absurd example:
"cut the water"

Engine:
“…That makes no sense.”

⸻

6) ✔ Action exists, no tool required → but target is NOT in this location

Player:

"open the fridge"

But they are at the playground.

Engine:
“There is no fridge here.”

⸻

Inner voice:
“Let’s see what’s inside…”

⸻

8) ✔ Self-actions (no object needed)

Player:
	•	"sit"
	•	"cry"
	•	"warm myself"

Engine:
“I lower myself for a moment…”
“…I guess I can cry.”

Absurd:
"cry aggressively"

Engine:
“…I can try, I guess.”

⸻

9) ✔ Tool + target + compatible functionality → SUCCESS

Player:

"ignite the wood with lighter"

Engine:
	•	fire created
	•	warmth effect applied

Inner voice:
“The flames catch. Good.”

⸻

10) ❌ Tool + target → EXTREMELY dangerous combo

Player:

"ignite the gasoline with lighter"

Engine:
🔥 Explosion event
HP −20

Inner voice:
“…That was a mistake.”

⸻

11) ✔ Player eats harmful food

Player:

"eat stale bread"

Item effect = poisonous

HP −5
Inner monologue:
“Something’s wrong with it…”

⸻

Player:

"unlock the door with scissors"

Scissors = cut
Door = unlock

Engine:
“That won’t unlock anything.”

⸻

Player:

"throw the dead woman"

dead_woman.movable = false

Engine:
“…She’s too heavy. I can’t move her.”

⸻

14) ❌ User tries an impossible tool → target combination

Player:

"ignite the corpse using yogurt"

Engine:
“Yogurt doesn’t burn.”

⸻

15) ✔ Creative chaotic but valid solution

Player:
