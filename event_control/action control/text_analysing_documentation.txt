Here is the breakdown of your new algorithm (v2.0), rewritten in English. It fully reflects the logic we implemented with Lonely/Complex tokens, Sentence Winners, and Smart Filtering.
ITEM RECOGNITION ALGORITHM (v2.0)
STEP 1 — Cleaning & Tokenization
We clean the user input by removing "rubbish words" (stop words: the, a, is, on, please...) and splitting the rest into tokens. Crucially, we preserve the original indices of the words.
 * User Input: "give me razor blased"
 * Cleaned: ["razor" (idx:2), "blased" (idx:3)]
STEP 2 — Item Evaluation (Calculation Loop)
Unlike standard search, we iterate through every item in the database and compare it against the cleaned sentence.
For every token in an item, we find the best Levenshtein match available in the user's sentence.
STEP 3 — Probability Calculation (The Fork)
The final probability depends on the item type:
 * A. Lonely Item (Single Token)
   * Probability = The Levenshtein Similarity of the matched word.
   * Example: User types "passport" → Item passport gets Score 0.9 (if typo) or 1.0.
 * B. Complex Item (Multi-Token)
   * First, calculate the Average Probability of all its tokens.
   * Second, calculate Compactness (Index Distance): How close are the matched words to each other in the user's sentence?
   * Probability = Average Probability × Compactness.
   * Logic: If words "hunting" and "knife" are 5 words apart, the probability drops significantly.
STEP 4 — Determine "Sentence Token Winners"
This is the "Capture the Flag" phase. For each specific word in the user's sentence, we record which Item ID had the highest similarity score.
 * Word "razor": Winner → razor_blades (Score 1.0)
 * Word "blased": Winner → razor_blades (Score 0.67)
This "Winners List" is used to validate context in the next step.
STEP 5 — Selection Tournament (Context Validation)
We take the Top 3 Candidates (sorted by Probability) and determine the final winner:
 * Find Complex Winner:
   * Is there a Complex Item in the top 3 whose tokens are listed as "Winners" in Step 4?
   * If yes → This item has "Context Support" and becomes the priority candidate.
 * Final Face-off:
   * Compare the Probability of the Supported Complex Candidate vs. the Best Overall Candidate.
   * The one with the higher score wins.
STEP 6 — Smart Filtering (The "Rescue" Logic)
The final check before returning the result. A candidate is accepted ONLY if:
 * High Probability: The score is > 0.85 (Strict Threshold).
   * OR
 * Strong Token Support: The score is medium (> 0.65), BUT the item contains at least one token with a perfect or near-perfect match (Score ≥ 0.9).
 * Example: razor blased (Prob 0.83). It fails Condition 1, but passes Condition 2 because "razor" is a 1.0 match.
RESULT
A list of identified items that survived the Smart Filter.
[ {"id": "razor_blades", "probability": 0.83, ...} ]

Example 


### TEST 1: Complex Perfect Match ###
Enter input text: cut the passport with razor blades

========================================
DEBUG LOG FOR: 'cut the passport with razor blades'
Cleaned Tokens: ['cut', 'passport', 'razor', 'blades']
--------------------
TOP 3 Candidates:
  > passport: Prob 1.00 | MaxToken 1.00 | Complex? False
  > razor_blades: Prob 1.00 | MaxToken 1.00 | Complex? True
  > pistol: Prob 0.38 | MaxToken 0.38 | Complex? False
--------------------
Sentence Token Winners (Word Context):
  Word 'cut' (idx 0) -> Won by 'hunting_knife' (Score: 0.29)
  Word 'passport' (idx 2) -> Won by 'passport' (Score: 1.00)
  Word 'razor' (idx 4) -> Won by 'razor_blades' (Score: 1.00)
  Word 'blades' (idx 5) -> Won by 'razor_blades' (Score: 1.00)
--------------------
Potential Complex Winner: razor_blades


Selected Candidate (Pre-Filter): razor_blades
Decisison: ACCEPTED 'razor_blades', and 'passport'(High Probability)
========================================


FINAL RESULT: ['razor_blades', 'passport']
