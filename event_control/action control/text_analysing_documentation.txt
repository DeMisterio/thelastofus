The text analysing breaks up in separate steps: 

1) The RasaNLU extracts the intent out of the text
2) We tokenize each word out of the sentence

["take", "the", "key", "out", "of", "the", "car"]


    {
        "id": "keys",
        "tokens": ["keys"]
        "type": "tool",
        "NV": null,
        "Eating_speed": null,
        "effect": null,
        "functionality": "unlock",
        "HarmRate": 0,
        "movable": {"access": true, "weight": 1}
    }

the token here is "keys"


and the word "key" outta the the text tokens has the closest Livenshtein distance => so the "keys" aare entity.
